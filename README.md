# config-util
## What is this?

This project allows building configuration files using any type.
You only need to provide a IConfigLoader, which can load the configuration file and a IConfigSaver, which can save the configuration file.
Anything else is handled by this project.

## About Semver:

I generally strive to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for all my projects.
But there are a few exceptions I have to communicate here (mainly because I have seen enough stuff in minecraft projects):
- The implementation of methods and Classes can change, even in Patch releases.
- Private methods and variables are considered implementation details.
- non-public methods and variables on final classes are considered implementation details.
- Annotations may be added or removed in Patch releases, if the method call is still [binary compatible](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.2).

This means, that any java bytecode manipulation or java reflection may break in Patch releases.

These rules are only in place, because I publish as java-version 8. If I had java modules, I would probably not have to add these notes.
